## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0]

Initial release.

### Added
- Attribute-driven column mapping (`[FixedColumn(start, length)]`) on properties and public fields.
- Parsing: single line plus lazy batch reading from a `TextReader`, `Stream` or file —
  synchronous (`IEnumerable<T>` with an allocation-free struct enumerator) and asynchronous
  (`IAsyncEnumerable<T>`), without allocating a string per line.
- Writing: single record and batches, synchronous and asynchronous, with `StreamWriter` reuse and
  `ReadOnlySpan<T>` overloads for zero-allocation output.
- Configurable per-column formatting: alignment, padding character, format string and an explicit
  overflow policy (no silent data loss).
- Culture-aware parsing/formatting for numeric and `ISpanParsable`/`ISpanFormattable` types
  (including fast `double`/`float` via csFastFloat).
- Layout validation at construction: rejects negative `Start`, non-positive `Length` and
  overlapping columns with a clear error.
- `ref struct` model support on the parser.
- A bundled Roslyn source generator: models implementing `IFixedWidthModel<TSelf>` get a
  reflection-free `TryParse` generated at compile time, with diagnostics (FWP001–FWP006) for invalid
  layouts. Shipped inside the package as an analyzer — no extra package required.
